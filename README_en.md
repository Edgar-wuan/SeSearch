## Introduction

eSearch is a :electron: rewrite of [information-portal](https://github.com/xushengfeng/Information-portal.git) (with a bi~~t~~llion features added by the way)

The main idea is to implement [Smartisan bigbang](https://www.smartisan.com/pr/videos/bigbang-introduction) or [Xiaomi portal](https://www.miui.com/zt/miui9/index.html) on Linux (it works on win and mac too) like **Screen Search** and of course a handy **Screenshot Software**.

I.e. **Screenshot+OCR+Search+Paste+Search by Image**

> The font is [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), the font can be set in the settings

## Download and install

Go to the website [eSearch](https://esearch.vercel.app/en.html#download) to download

Or open the releases tab on the right, select the package that matches your system and download and install it

Quick download link in China: [Releases - xushengfeng/eSearch - fastgit](https://hub.fastgit.xyz/xushengfeng/eSearch/releases)

ArchLinux can be found at AUR to install `e-search` or `e-search-git`.

winget `winget install esearch`

## OCR Services

The software does not come with a local OCR core service, but will prompt for a download when launched.

Local OCR is supported by [PaddleOCR](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR), which publishes the compiled service in [eSearch-OCR](https://github.com/xushengfeng/eSearch-OCR).

The local OCR service is enabled by default, but if you wish to use the online OCR, Baidu Online OCR is currently available and requires [a tutorial](https://cloud.baidu.com/doc/OCR/s/dk3iqnq51) to obtain the _API KEY_ and _Secret KEY_, which is still available for [free](https://cloud.baidu.com/doc/OCR/s/dk3iqnq51) as of January 2022. Fill in the _API KEY_ and _Secret KEY_ and the corresponding [_URL_](https://cloud.baidu.com/doc/OCR/s/zk3h7xz52#%E8%AF%B7%E6%B1%82%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%8E) of your chosen text recognition service into the software settings and uncheck the offline OCR box to use the online OCR.

## Run & compile the source code

Compiling requires `python` and `C++`, for Windows you need `python `and `visual studio` (to install C++)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/xushengfeng/eSearch.git
cd eSearch
npm install
# Run
npx electron .
# ç¼–è¯‘
npm run rebuild
npm run dist
# The directory where the installer will be produced and unpacked in the build directory
```

### Modifying installed programs

First press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd>, or in the menu bar - Literacy - Developer Tools Open the developer tools for debugging. Modify the debugging to know that you are happy with it, before making changes to the source code.

```shell
# Install asar
npm install -g asar
asar e [the location prompted in the settings to run]
# Unzip and modify in the app directory
# Build the package
asar p app app.asar
# Just restart the software
```

## Launch

Open eSearch in your launcher and it will appear in the tray. Gnome users need to install the [appindicator](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/) plugin

The default shortcut is <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> (you can also set the shortcut in the settings)

### Shortcuts on Linux

Most Linux desktop environments support custom shortcuts. **eSearch** supports cli, which also means you can set shortcuts at system level

```shell
esearch (if you can not find it, try e-search)
	-a # auto-search
	-c # screen search
	-s # select search
	-b # clipboard search
	-q # Quick screenshot
```

It is not recommended to do an automatic or selected search in the terminal, otherwise **eSearch** will perform <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>, which will cause the terminal program to terminate

## Testing

Wayland desktop environment not supported at this time

## Development reasons

I've been using this great screenshot software for Windows: [Snipaste - Snip & Paste](https://www.snipaste.com/), but I've switched to Linux and Snipaste is not supported, so I've chosen [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/), which unfortunately doesn't have an intuitive colour picker.

Another incentive for me to develop eSearch was that I enjoyed using [Smartisan bigbang](https://www.smartisan.com/pr/videos/bigbang-introduction) or [Xiaomi Portal](https://www.miui.com/zt/miui9/index.html) on my phone, but I couldn't find a similar replacement on my computer.

So I simply developed my own "screenshot + OCR + search + mapping" software. At first I developed [Information-portal](https://github.com/xushengfeng/Information-portal.git) using python+pyqt, but since I'm not familiar with pyqt, I switched to :electron: and developed this software. ðŸ˜„
